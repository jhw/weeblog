A micro blogging framework; because -

- everything out there looks crap and doesn't support the feature set I want
- `Bootstrap/Bootswatch` makes it easy to whip up a simple blogging UI
- `python3` has all the libraries you need to munge the markdown and HTML - `markdown`, `lxml`, `jinja2`
- `S3` is a nice and simple hosting platform

See `/demo` for example.
